                                        I am excited about my work as a full-stack engineer and pride myself on my ability to collaborate, education, innovate and grow. Employers and coworkers have all said that I am an excellent team member, innovative, and driven. Iâ€™m not afraid to voice my opinion, even to those above my paygrade, and believe in kindness and good humor for all.
